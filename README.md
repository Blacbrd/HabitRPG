# HabitRPG
A habit tracker that acts like a videogame RPG

This is an idea I got after reading Atomic Habits, and stumbling across Habitica. This will be a medium term project, and I'll probably spend from 6-12 months working on it.

The main aim of this habit app is to provide a way to visualise leveling up as the user completes real life tasks. They will have a main experience bar, alongside stats that can be individually levelled up.
For example, if the user has a workout habit, after completing it, their vitality and strength increases, and their main level increases a bit.

However, if the user doesn't complete a task, then these stats and their level will fall.

One thing I noticed about Habitica, is while it is a really immersive habit tracker that allows people to truly turn their life into a game, there seems to be quite a learning curve into fully utilising the app.
Therefore, I want to create something a lot simpler, that still engages the user.

# What I'm currently working on

* Creating a Unity environment
* Pushing a button and having a bar update



I will be updating this README file as I make progress on the game/habit tracker.
